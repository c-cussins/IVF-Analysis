Objective: To analyse and understand the current trends and figures related to fertility treatments in the UK, and what drives success in IVF between 1991-2018. 
Utilised Pandas, Matplotlib and Plotly in Python to join, transform and explore anonymised data from Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), creating a clean CSV with 1.5M rows of data. Further exploration was then performed in SQL and Excel.
EDA and visualisations were performed in Tableau, looking at the success of IVF across age, year, treatment type and outcomes of IVF, with the creation of an IVF success predictor.
